# Example projects

This directory contains reference projects that use the simple-rpg framework. They are intentionally lightweight and meant to be copied into your own project layout.

- `intro_ui`: A minimal intro menu with "New Game", "Load Game", and "Exit" options built on top of the provided scene and game loop abstractions.

## Running the intro UI example

From the repository root, install the project dependencies (e.g., `pip install -e .`) and run:

```bash
python -m example.intro_ui.main
```
